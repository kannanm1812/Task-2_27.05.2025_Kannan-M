📧 Sample Email Summary
Subject Line: URGENT: Your Account Has Been Suspended!
Sender: support@paypall-security.com
Email Received On: May 27, 2025

🚨 Phishing Indicators Identified
Indicator	Description	Why It's Suspicious
1. Spoofed Sender Address	The email claims to be from PayPal but the domain is paypall-security.com	Legitimate companies use official domains (paypal.com)
2. Urgent/Threatening Language	Subject: “URGENT: Your Account Has Been Suspended”	Phishing emails create fear to prompt immediate action
3. Mismatched URL	Hovering over "Verify Now" shows http://bit.ly/3fakeurl instead of a PayPal URL	Fake links redirect to malicious sites
4. Suspicious Attachment	Email contains a .zip file named Account_Details.zip	Attachments can contain malware or ransomware
5. Grammar and Spelling Errors	“Your acount has been suspended due to unautorized access.”	Poor grammar is a common phishing sign
6. No Personalization	Starts with “Dear Customer”	Real emails usually address you by name
7. Fake Logo or Branding	The logo is blurry and not aligned properly	Scammers often use copied or altered images
